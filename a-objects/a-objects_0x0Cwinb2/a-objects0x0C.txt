this is small growing externals set for max msp jitter by cycling74. ranges from utility objects to some 3d work and more. it used to support os9 and osx for macintosh. it will now support osx on macintosh and also a windows version soon.


install notes:
-	move the folder 'a-objects_0x0C' somewhere max knows of
-	copy 'a-obj overview 0x0C' to max/patches/extras

modifications: 
- the a-objects have moved from sier.risco.pt/code/a-objects to s373.net/code/a-objects
- the license is Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (a human readable version is enclosed in the file "Creative Commons Deed.html". more at http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/)
- this is donationware: if you'd like to donate to this project, please use the paypal link s373.net/code/a-objects

support:
	max version 4.3 and higher, though some externals might only run on max 4.5 and higher.
	jitter 1.2.3 and higher
	osx 
	os9 (unsupporting transition: if you need externals for os9 systems please contact me)
	windows (not yet, expected early december)
	
new objects:
	a-fifo: first-in-first-out method for groups of y points in x dimensions
	a-hspline3d: hermite splines interpolation method in 3 dimensions
	gl_grid: makes a 3d grid
	gl_ruthetra: translates a 2d jitter char uniplanar matrix into a 3d surface
	a-hemisphere: maps a xy list to a hemisphere
	
removed objects:
	a-fifo3d4: superceded by a-fifo
	a-colis‹o016: buggy colision detection; removed until a better thingie comes
	a-espelho: no need for a mirror coordinates object
	a-ber: better a regular 3dheading obj
	
fixes:
	a-3dkernel: getcombined message fixed
	tiny mods in help patches
	a-line3d: stack method ˆ l‡ a-hspline3d


todo:
	fix assist message in all gl_* objects
	gl_terrain: dynamic dimensions
	gl_grid: error messages in max window are deprecating performance (bypassable with js)
	gl_ruthetra: dynamic dimensions
	a-a: outputting result+1
	a-ber: replace with simple atan2 (though a 3d one might be better to replace with)
	a-cloud help file
	seed a-rand

history:

__history / changes vs.0x0B__20040807

- - new objects make the distrib: a-3dkernel, a-proj, a-perp, a-cloud,
a-plane, a-gaussnoise~;
- - a-cam got a major speed boost due to avoiding sqrt calls on the
normalizing of the vectors;
- - the overview file has _not_ been updated;


__history / changes vs.0x0A__20040520

- - new objects make the distrib: a-pt2plane, a-terr, a-12many, a-delta,
a-cam, a-grav;
- - a-mar now supports grids of 100x100km;
- - fixed import bug in the terrain objects; now supports custom grids;
- - fixed many relevant bugs in calculations over a bunch of objects;


__history / changes vs.0x09__20040418

- - a-chng replaced with a-change;
- - gl_terrain and gl_terrain2 max dim size expanded to 256x256 grids
for finer resolution;
- - a-rand has been changed due to random repetition issues; 
new simpler only list method to define the output range of values; 
all is random when you cant find the link;
- - fixed init arguments lookup in geometry objects; it was kinda buggy;
and a-lissa's help patch as well;
- - remade a-azi2360 and made a-3602azi (with aliases like a-360toazi
and a-azito360);
- - added a method alias on a-hv;


__history / changes vs.0x08__20040406

- - fixed wrap, fold functions, they were overflowing, all works now
nicely in a-map;
- - new: a-azi2360; 
- - fixed a-line2d and 3d so that they implement poly points response
and they ended up working something like line and bline;


__history / changes vs.0x07__20040402

- - fixed geometry objects input args; now all operate seamlessly;
- - new geometry objects: a-line2d, a-line3d; a-pad;
- - fixed hv over 2 args;

__history / changes vs.0x06__20040330

- - chaotic objects have been moved to the A-Chaos Lib, available at
http://cycling74.com/share/sier
- - new object a-smooth
- - a-hv has been touched; a-swarm as well;

__history / changes vs.0x05__20040217

- - first OSX fully compatible version!
- - new objects (a-swarm, a-polys, a-hv, a-count, a-elips, a-lissa,
a-rand, gl's)! 
- - some objects from previous versions disappear (a-alea,
a-x2y,a-version,etc)
- - the nato objects are now obsolete and unsupported, but available at
sier.risco.pt/code;


__history / changes vs.0x04__20031209

- - os9 only, like previous versions; 
- - minor code changes;
